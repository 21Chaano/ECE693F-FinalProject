# ECE693F-FinalProject
My final project for ECE693F: Software Reverse Engineering

The objective of this project is to analyze and compare different methods of anti SRE techniques.

The metrics to compare these methods are:
- How close can I recreate the original program
- How long does it take for me to recreate the original program

For methods harder to explore on my own, I will instead analyze how they work, and how much of the CIA (Confidentialiyt, Integrity, and Availability) Triangle the method satisfies.
